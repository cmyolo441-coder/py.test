"""Error-recovery hints: break the model's blind same-tool retry loop.

INCIDENT (2026-10-09): a 512-second turn in which the model failed the
same edit over and over with no guidance — every failed tool result went
back into the conversation, but nothing ever suggested a different
approach.

This module keeps a tiny ledger of consecutive failures per tool name.
On the 2nd consecutive failure of the same tool it returns a system-hint
string suggesting concrete alternatives (re-read the file region, use
exact text, try line-number-based edit, ...). Any successful call of a
tool resets that tool's counter, and a different tool failing tracks its
own counter.

Wiring (see the ``# retryhint hook`` in ``agent.py`` ``_finish_one``)::

    from .retryhint import note_failure, note_success
    if ev.status == "error":
        hint = note_failure(name, ev.result)
        if hint:
            self.messages.append({"role": "system", "content": hint})
    else:
        note_success(name)

Only stdlib is imported. State is a small dict keyed by tool name, so it
cannot grow unboundedly even in a very long session.

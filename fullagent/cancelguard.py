"""CANCELGUARD — prompt-cancellation primitives for the turn path.

Every blocking wait a turn can hit (model HTTP calls, retry backoffs,
web fetches, speculative prefetches, subagent chat calls) goes through
here, so Esc/Ctrl+C interrupts within ~CANCEL_POLL seconds instead of
hanging for minutes (the user reported Esc taking 203s — that was a
subagent's rate-limit backoff sleeping ~254s with zero cancel checks,
plus model POSTs that blocked in connect/DNS with no timeout at all).

Design rules:
  * Polling, never signals: the turn thread stays in charge; no
    cross-thread exceptions, no torn state.
  * `run_cancellable(fn, should_cancel)` runs fn() on a daemon worker
    and polls with a short timeout. On cancel it raises TurnCancelled on
    the caller and *abandons* the worker — the worker keeps running to
    completion in the background (harmless: it owns no turn state), and
    if it eventually produces a closeable result it is closed so no
    socket/connection leaks.
  * All helpers are exception-safe: a raising should_cancel callback is
    treated as "not cancelled", never as a crash.

"""File change detection: mtime+size tracking between read and edit.

Incident (512s turn): the agent's ``old_string`` didn't match the file at
edit time — likely the file changed between the agent's read and its edit
(external edit, another tool, a rerun). The failure surfaced as a cryptic
"old_string not found" instead of pointing at the real cause.

This module keeps a tiny per-agent store: ``{realpath: (mtime_ns, size)}``.
``read_file`` records the stat when the agent reads; ``edit_file`` /
``multi_edit`` re-stat before applying and, on mismatch, return a clear
warning telling the agent to re-read and retry instead of failing
cryptically. After the agent's own write/edit, the new stat is recorded so
its own writes never trip the check.

"""Early-exit nudge (permanent-fix sprint, worker 10/20).

Why: the agent burns all 25 tool calls even when it already has enough
information to answer after ~8. Stopping the model from calling tools
happens naturally IF the model stops on its own — but some models keep
"verifying" compulsively: re-reading files they already read, re-running
the same successful command, re-listing the same directory.

This module tracks a cheap per-result *novelty score* (0.0 = nothing new,
1.0 = all new). When the last 3 tool calls all produced near-zero novelty
AND the turn has already gathered substantial information (>= ``min_calls``
calls), ``note()`` returns a soft system hint urging the model to answer
now instead of making more tool calls. It never hard-stops — the model is
free to keep going; the hint is a nudge, not a gate. At most one hint per
turn, so it can never become token bloat of its own.

Signals (cheap, deterministic, stdlib-only):
  1. exact-duplicate result text (sha256 of normalised text) -> 0.0
  2. same read-type tool + same normalised args (re-read)     -> 0.0
  3. token containment: fraction of this result's significant tokens
     already seen in earlier results -> novelty = 1 - that fraction
Empty or failed results are ignored for novelty purposes (loopdetect owns
failures; an empty write result is not "redundant").

Integration: agent.py's turn loop instantiates one ``EarlyExitTracker``
per turn (next to the loopdetect detector) and calls ``note()`` after
every tool result inside ``_finish_one``. A non-None return is appended
as a ``{"role": "system"}`` message — the same injection pattern retryhint
already uses — so the model sees it before the next completion.

Only stdlib. Safe to import at module level (no heavy deps). Thread-safe.

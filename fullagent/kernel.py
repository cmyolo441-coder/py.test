"""Temporal Kernel — the Mul Bindu.

Every interaction with reality is recorded as an immutable, causally-ordered,
content-addressed event in a single append-only log. Nothing else is state.
State is a pure fold over that log.

Design (pure Python, stdlib only):
  * JSONL is truth. One line per event, append-only, fsync'd.
  * Content addressing: each event's id = sha256 of its canonical encoding.
  * Merkle spine: each event carries its parent's id, so the log is
    tamper-evident and any prefix is independently verifiable.
  * Seqs are global and strictly monotonic — never reused, on any branch.
  * A branch is a head pointer (an event id). Its history is the parent
    chain walked back from the head; events abandoned by a rewind or not
    chosen by a fork simply fall off the chain (fold horizon shrinks).
  * Fork at seq N seeds the new branch's head at event N, so the fork
    inherits the source's history up to the fork point.
  * Rewind moves the head pointer back to the event at seq N and seals a
    'kernel.rewind' marker (parent = event N) so the move survives reload.
    Events are never deleted. (Append-only is sacred.)
  * Reload replays the file in order: every append moved its branch's head
    to the new event, so head pointers rebuild without any second file.
  * Fold: a pure function from a branch's chain to a State projection.
    Rewind, replay, resume, audit, and cost attribution are all folds.
